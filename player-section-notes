<!--      <inventory>
         <!-- Determines the maximum weight of the inventory.  0 means the
              inventory has unlimited size.  Any integer greater than 0
              determines the inventory's maximum capacity (consider this the
              sum total of all object weights.)  For example, if object "candle"
              is defined with a weight of 2, and object "sword" is defined with
              a weight of 10, and the inventory weight is defined to be 11, you
              can then hold either the candle or the sword, but not both.  What
              integers you choose to use are totally up to you and are
              completely subjective.
