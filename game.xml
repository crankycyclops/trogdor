              determines the inventory's maximum capacity (consider this the
              sum total of all object weights.)  For example, if object "candle"
              is defined with a weight of 2, and object "sword" is defined with
              a weight of 10, and the inventory weight is defined to be 11, you
              can then hold either the candle or the sword, but not both.  What
              integers you choose to use are totally up to you and are
              completely subjective.

You're standing in the middle of a sprawling white marble castle, the walls lined with portraits of long deceased ancestors of some forgotten king.  Servants are bustling about, rushing around with steaming plates of meats and cooked vegetables, rushing in and out of rooms to serve princes and heads of state.

You peer off into the distance and notice a dark hole in the wall a little ways to the north.
