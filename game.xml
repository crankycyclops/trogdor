You're standing in the middle of a sprawling white marble castle, the walls lined with portraits of long deceased ancestors of some forgotten king.  Servants are bustling about, rushing around with steaming plates of meats and cooked vegetables, rushing in and out of rooms to serve princes and heads of state.

You peer off into the distance and notice a dark hole in the wall a little ways to the north.

You're in a dark musty cave.  You see a light some ways off to the south.  To the west, you spy a large dark chamber of some sort.
