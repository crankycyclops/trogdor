trogdor
=======

A text adventure engine written in C

Dependencies:
LibXML2
GLib
My dstring library (http://www.github.com/crankycyclops/dstring)
Lua 5.1
PThread

I've split the code into two components: core (trogdor's data and functionality) and standalone (wraps around core for a single player experience.)  The reason for the separation is that I plan to write a MUD based on core in the (hopefully) not too distant future.

To compile standalone, just type (so far, only tested on Ubuntu 12.04):

make

Or, if you're on FreeBSD (until I have a more elegant build system):
gcc -L/usr/local/lib -I/usr/local/include -I/usr/local/include/libxml2 \
-I/usr/local/include/lua51 -ldstring -lxml2 `pkg-config -cflags \
-libs glib-2.0` -pthread src/core/*.c -llua-5.1 src/standalone/*.c \
-o trogdor
